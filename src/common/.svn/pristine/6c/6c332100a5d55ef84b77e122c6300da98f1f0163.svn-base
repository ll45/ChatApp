 * This message is sent to a chatroom by a user who wishes to join that chatroom. The datapacket

 * the chatroom.
 * 
 * The message contains a serialized user stub for the sender.
 * Thus, the user should call getUserStub() on this message and get the user stub of the 
 * sender. If they don't already have that user stub, they should call registerUser() on that stub
 * so they can connect to them.
