/**
 * An interface that represents a single Chatroom object.
 * 
 * A Chatroom object is simply a collection of IMsgReceiver stubs. Any IMsgReceiver stub
 * is tied to the mini-MVC containing that Chatroom object on a remote user's system, and
 * the IMsgReceiver may be used by the Chatroom object on the local user's system to 
 * communicate with the Chatroom object on the remote user's system.
 * 
 * <p>
 * 1. CREATING a Chatroom
 * <p>
 *    > A Chatroom object is created locally and tied to a unique identifier (UID). This
 *      object is serializable.
 * <p>
 *    > This action is NOT PART OF THE API! It is merely noted here for reference 
 *      purposes.
 * <p>
 *    
 * 2. JOINING a Chatroom
 * <p>
 * 	  > There are two possible methods for joining a chatroom:
 * 
 * 		- INVITING a user to join
 * 			The local user inviting the remote user to join a chatroom they're part of must
 * 			send the remote user an IJoinInvite message. This message contains a serialized copy
 * 			of the Chatroom object that the remote user can then create a mini-MVC for. The 
 * 			remote user may choose to decline this invitation.
 * 		
 * 		- REQUESTING to join
 * 			The user wishing to join must send an IJoinRequest message to any user already in the
 * 			chatroom. This IJoinRequest is tied to the chatroom's UID. If the receiver chooses
 * 			to accept the join request, they respond with an IJoinInvite message containing the serialized
 * 			Chatroom object. The join request may be declined.
 * 		
 * <p>
 * 	  > Upon receipt of the IJoinInvite message, a user may send an IAddUser message to all IMsgReceivers in the
 * 		chatroom. The IAddUser message contains an IMsgReceiver stub tied to the local mini-MVC representing that
 * 		chatroom. All users then simply add this IMsgReceiver stub to their instance of the serialized chatroom.
 * 
 *    > After joining, the user automatically exchanges IUser stubs with all other users in that chatroom.
 *      This ensures all users are directly connected to each other, and one user leaving the chatroom will
 *      not disconnect anyone else.
 * <p>
 *    
 * 3. LEAVING a Chatroom
 * <p>
 *    > Any user who wishes to leave this chatroom simply sends an IQuit message to all IMsgReceivers
 *      in the chatroom. This deletes the user's IMsgReceiver stub from all copies of the Chatroom object. 
 *      The user can then delete their copy of the Chatroom object.
 * <p>
 * 
 * 4. DELETING a Chatroom
 * <p>
 *    > A Chatroom should be automatically deleted once all users have left that chatroom (there are no more IMsgReceivers
 *      still in the chatroom).
 *    > This action is NOT part of the API! It is noted here merely for reference purposes.
